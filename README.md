Personalized Greeting App
This project is a simple Personalized Greeting App that generates customized messages for users based on their input. The app takes the user's name and age and responds with a personalized greeting, letting the user know if they are eligible for a specific course or if the details entered are invalid.

Features:
Prompts users to enter their name and age.
Provides a personalized greeting based on the user's age.
Displays eligibility for a course if the user is 18 or older.
Displays a different message for users below the age of 18 or for invalid details.

How It Works:
The user clicks the Submit button.
The app prompts the user to enter their name and age.
Based on the input:
If the age is 30 or above, the user is considered eligible for identity card.
If the age is between 10 and 12, the user is informed that they are not eligible for the Id card.
If the input is less than 5 or an invalid number, the user receives an invalid details message.
The personalized message is dynamically displayed on the webpage.
